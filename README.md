# About Our App
    -This application was created for users to find local events in their cities. What makes this application stand out from other event apps is that when a city is searched, events in that city are presented alongside the current weather in that city. They are also presented with an option to save their events to a schedule.
    
# How The App Functions
    -When users open the homepage they are presented with an introduction explaining the app and a get started button at the bottom that will take them into it.

    -When the user clicks the get started button then they are taken to the Make My Day search application.

    -When the user enters the app, then they are presetned with a search box instructing them to type in a city.
    
    -When the user types a city in the search box and clicks the search button then they are presented with event cards listing local events in that city. At the bottom of the event cards listing, the user is also presented with the five day forecast for that city. 

    -When the user finds an event they are interested in, then the user can click the get tickets button where they are redirected to the ticketing site to check availability of tickets and instructions on purchasing tickets.

    -If they wish to save their events then they are presented with a save event button that will create a saved event list for them that they can go back to after looking at various events.
